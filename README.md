## Project Requirements:

You must work from the code in https://github.com/CodeCraftCurriculum-I/module_8_dungon

Before you write any code, you should "sketch" the pseudo code and make a flowchart for how you plan to do the following alterations to the game.

NB! Some of the requierments might require you to write code not explicitly spelled out in the requierments, use your judgment.


- There is no menu, make a sensible menu USE MENU FROM PREVIOUS ASSIGNMENTS
    Play game
        Char name custom
        Char class
            Choose between rogue / warrior or random
                Rogue: 5hp
                Warrior: 10hp
    Settings
        Language
    Quit Game
    
## There is a character sheetish thing for the player but it mostly does nothing, make it so that more than the name has meaning. 

- Create a gameover screen that summarizes the players achivment (this new screen should redirect to the menu in some whay when the player presses anny key)
    Show total XP
    Any relevant stat
    At the bottom:
        "Press enter to continue" => redirects to menu

- Currently there are enemies. They dont have an effect give them the abbility to do soemthing.
    Enemy does damage, you lose that damage to HP
    If they do less damage than you do, you win
    
- Create a new type of pickup.

### Challenge Requirements (Higher Grades):

- Make a new NPC that moves.

- Make friendly NPC.

About assesment:

Assessment for this project will be based not just on feature completion, but also on your attention to detail, the cleanliness and readability of your code, and the thoughtfulness of your README file reflections. This is your opportunity to demonstrate not just what you've learned, but how you can apply it creatively and effectively in a real programming project.
